# census-react-app

Replacement for [afrith/census-web](https://github.com/afrith/census-web) as a React app with server-side rendering on initial load. Displays information from the South African National Census of 2011. Built with [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle) and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/). Depends on the API from [afrith/census-graphql-api](https://github.com/afrith/census-graphql-api).

Currently incomplete and still under development.
